0/ Introduction
===============

Ccluster is a C library providing implementations of algorithms for computing 
clusters of complex roots of univariate polynomials which coefficients are any
complex numbers, possibly given as oracle numbers.

It provides two binaries, bin/ccluster and bin/risolate, that take in input
a file .ccl (containing the definition of a polynomial)
and respectively compute clusters of complex roots and isolate real roots
of the input polynomial.
See bin/ccluster_spiral.c for example of use within a C program for 
input polynomials given as oracles

The implemented algorithm for complex root clustering is described here:
https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2930889.2930939

The github repository is:

There is an interface for Julia called Ccluster.jl:
https://github.com/rimbach/Ccluster.jl

and Ccluster can be used in Singular (see README.md for more informations).


1/ Installation and getting started
===================================

   1 Satisfying dependencies
   --------------------------
   ccluster is based on FLINT and ARB.
   In turn, FLINT and ARB depend on GMP and MPFR.
   To satisfy the dependencies:
   - download and install GMP, version 6.1.2 or later: https://gmplib.org/#DOWNLOAD
   - download and install MPFR, version 4.0.0 or later: https://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/
   - download and install FLINT, version 2.6.1 or later: http://flintlib.org/downloads.html
   - download and install ARB, version 2.18.0 or later: http://arblib.org/setup.html#download
   
   2 Compile Ccluster
   ------------------
   In ccluster repository:

    ./configure
    make
    
    optionally, you can install the binaries in /usr/local/ with
    
    make install
    
    if one of the 4 above mentioned library is not in a standard place, do 
    ./ configure --with-XXX="path-to-XXX" where XXX is either gmp or flint or mpfr or arb
    
    3 Run tests and get started about using the binaries ccluster and risolate
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    make test
